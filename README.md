# HR Data Analytics Dashboard-Excel And PowerBI

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing HR data to derive insights regarding employee attrition, demographics, education levels, job roles, and job satisfaction. The analysis was performed using both Excel and Power BI, with dashboards created in each tool to visualize key metrics. The objective was to identify trends and patterns in employee attrition, with a focus on understanding which factors influence it the most.

## Problem Statement
**Business Challenge :**  Employee attrition is a critical issue for the HR department. The challenge was to identify the factors contributing to high attrition rates and determine which departments, job roles, education fields, and age groups are most affected. The goal was to use data analytics to provide actionable insights that the HR department could use to reduce turnover and improve employee satisfaction.

## Project Phases

### 1. Requirements Gathering
- The primary goal was to analyze HR-related metrics, focusing on employee attrition.
- Key metrics include:
1. Total Employees
2. Attrition Count and Rate
3. Active Employees
4. Age Distribution
5. Education Levels by Attrition
6. Gender Distribution
7. Attrition by Department, Job Role, and Marital Status
8. Job Satisfaction Ratings

### 2. Data Overview
- The dataset includes multiple columns such as Employee ID, Department, Job Role, Education Field, Attrition Status, Gender, Age, Job Satisfaction Ratings, and more.
- Total records: 1,470 employee data points.
- Key focus: To understand the relationship between employee demographics and attrition rates.
  
### 3. Data Connection and Import
**Excel:** The raw HR data was loaded into Excel, and basic cleaning tasks were performed using Excelâ€™s built-in functions.

**Power BI:** The same dataset was imported into Power BI for advanced data processing and visualization.

### 4. Data Cleaning
- Missing Values: Checked for and removed null values where necessary.
- Data Normalization: Converted data types (e.g., string to categorical, numerical to percentages) to ensure consistency across platforms.
- Duplicates: Removed any duplicate entries from the dataset.
- Column Renaming: Cleaned column names for better readability.
  
### 5. Data Processing
- Data Enrichment: Added calculated columns in Power BI, such as Attrition Rate, Active Employee Count, and Education Level by Attrition.
- Filtering and Sorting: Applied filters to segregate data based on department, education field, job role, and gender.
  
### 6. Data Modeling
- In Power BI, relationships between tables were established to create a more dynamic model.
- Excel: Pivot tables were used to create dynamic reports by department, education level, and job role.

### 7. Charts and Dashboard Design
**Excel:** Developed a dashboard using pivot charts, pie charts, bar charts, and slicers.
- Key Metrics Displayed:
- Total Employees, Active Employees, Attrition Count, and Attrition Rate.
- Attrition by Department, Education, Age Group, and Job Role.
- Gender and Marital Status Breakdown.

**Power BI:** Created interactive visuals using pie charts, clustered bar charts, and tables.
- Visualizations included:
- Department-wise and Job Role-wise Attrition.
- Attrition by Age Group and Marital Status.
- Education Fields Affected by Attrition.

### 8. Reports and Dashboard Building
**Excel Dashboard:** The dashboard was designed to provide HR teams with a quick overview of key metrics, using slicers to filter data based on department or job role.

**Power BI Dashboard:** A more interactive and dynamic dashboard was built to allow users to explore attrition trends and cross-filter based on various attributes such as education level, job satisfaction, and gender.

### 9. Insights
- Attrition Rate: The overall attrition rate was found to be 16.12% in Excel and 18.24% in Power BI, highlighting a need for improvement.
Key Findings:
- Department-Wise Attrition: The Sales department showed the highest attrition rate, while R&D had the lowest.
- Education Levels: Employees with lower education levels (e.g., High School) had a higher attrition rate compared to those with higher degrees.
- Job Satisfaction: Employees in roles like Sales Executive and Manufacturing Director reported lower job satisfaction, which correlated with higher attrition.
- Age Group: The age group 25-34 exhibited the highest attrition, potentially due to career transitions.
- Marital Status: Single employees had a higher attrition rate compared to their married counterparts.
- Actionable Insight: Focus retention strategies on high-risk groups, such as younger employees and those in lower education levels or dissatisfied job roles.

### 10.Conclusion
The analysis provided valuable insights into the factors influencing employee attrition. By focusing on the departments, roles, and demographics most affected, the HR department can create targeted strategies to reduce turnover and improve job satisfaction. Both the Excel and Power BI dashboards serve as tools for monitoring and addressing these issues in real-time.
